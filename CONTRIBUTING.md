# Contributing A Patch

If you're interested in working on an existing issue, simply respond to the issue and express interest in working on it.
This helps other people know that the issue is active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue or comment on an existing issue describing the proposed change and the implementation.
2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
3. If your proposed change is accepted, fork the repository.
4. Write your code, test your changes and _communicate_ with us as you're moving forward.
5. Submit a pull request.
6. Maintainers will review your code, provide feedback, and ultimately merge your changes.

## Adding dependencies

If your patch depends on new packages, the dependencies must:

- be approved by Aembit maintainers ahead of time
- use an approved license
